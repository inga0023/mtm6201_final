This project was particularly challenging for me due to my lack of familiarity with Bootstrap. Coding isn't my strong suit, and it caused significant stress and anxiety, leading to procrastination. I found the process difficult and not enjoyable, which added to the challenge. Despite these hurdles, I made an effort to incorporate my own images into the website. However, I struggled to find enough suitable images to include, but I did my best with what I had.

My website may not be particularly exciting and contains limited content. However, I challenged myself by attempting to use a more complex layout, even though it wasn't easy for me. I wanted to push myself to try something more advanced, and while it was a challenge, I'm grateful that I managed to complete the project.

Web development is definitely not my thing; honestly, it feels almost impossible for me. Every time I face it, I find myself overwhelmed because it's so difficult and complex. However, it does push me to think bigger and stretch my abilities, which I appreciate, as it helps me grow. Inaddition, In this project, I wasn't able to fully express my creativity because I didn't feel capable of coding the beautiful designs I envisioned. Instead, I focused on creating something that would help me get my grades. It's disappointing for me, but sometimes that's just the way it goes. Thank you.
